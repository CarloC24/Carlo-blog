    "weekly_journal": "Biggest challenge of the week is Getting used to with the git workflow. I implemented the authentication token system with JWT and Cookies. And used a php module to hash emails and make it a Universal Avatar (gravatar) and I handled Creating users in a secure way with Bcrypt. Then I hooked up my routes into the front end which I did the login form! So far everything is working out with my part and I helped fix bugs on deployment with the Procfile from heroku "
